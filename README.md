# WebRTC Classroom
This is an implementation of WebRTC to allow users to join a hosted room, with no client limit, and for the room owner to be able to broadcast video (webcam or screen-share) to these clients.
This implementation also features the WebRTC Data Channel, allowing the host to send files to the clients of the room.

Implemented with WebRTC, socket.io, and nodejs
